# Angular 4 Alerting System

A user alerting system using Bootstrap 3 alerts. Alerts display on the screen for X seconds then fade out in Z seconds (X and Z = whatever you like). The length of time to display and fade out an alert is set within the Alert class. The alerts can appear in the top or botton of the browser window and aligned to the right, center or left. Similar to Toaster or Noty built on Angular 4. 

The alerts can be customized with images, bold text, etc. or whatever you can imagine but are based on Bootstrap 3 alerts.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
